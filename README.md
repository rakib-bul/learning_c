##A repository of my learning progress of C

#About This Repo
This repository contains my progress, code examples, and mini-projects as I learn C programming from scratch. It includes:
✔ Basic syntax and concepts (variables, loops, functions, pointers)
✔ Practice programs (algorithms, data structures, system programming)
✔ Small projects (file I/O, CLI tools, game logic)
✔ Notes and references for quick revision
